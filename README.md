- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Use roles to manage user permissions effectively. You can assign different access levels to users, ensuring that sensitive data stays protected.

- **Rate Limiting**: Protect your API from excessive requests with rate limiting. This feature prevents abuse and ensures fair use.

- **Account Lockout**: If too many failed login attempts occur, this feature locks the user's account temporarily. This helps fend off unauthorized access.

- **Audit Logging**: Create a detailed log of user activities. This feature helps you monitor for any suspicious actions.
